h2. rbot plugins

This is just a little place to store rbot plugins that I am working on for #yui on freenode.

h3. Current List:

   * logger: MySQL channel logging. Supports being logged into multiple channels.

h3. In progress:
   
   * First Join Message: support for sending the user a message the first time they are seen. Kind of like a channel rules message.

h3. Ideas:

   * github stats: Ask the bot to fetch GitHub commits from the GitHub API
   * jseval: A plugin to eval JavaScript
   * docs:  YUI doc search
